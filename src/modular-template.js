/*	http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html

	Any file can set properties on their local variable _private, and it will be
	immediately available to the others. Once this module has loaded completely,
	the application should call MODULE._seal(), which will prevent external access
	to the internal _private. If this module were to be augmented again, further in
	the applicationâ€™s lifetime, one of the internal methods, in any file, can call
	_unseal() before loading the new file, and call _seal() again after it has been
	executed. This pattern occurred to me today while I was at work, I have not seen
	this elsewhere. I think this is a very useful pattern, and would have been worth
	writing about all on its own.
